## **🔍 Key Features**  
   - ![Task-Wise Performance](figures/task-wise-performance.png)  

1. **Hybrid Search Mechanism**  
   - Utilizes **Semantic Search (context-based retrieval)** + **Lexical Search (keyword-based retrieval)**  
   - Ensures accurate document retrieval for precise answers  
   - 📊 **[Top-K Retrieval Performance](figures/top-k.pdf)** → Performance analysis of retrieval quality  

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
   - Generates **factual and context-aware answers** using retrieved documents  
   - Fine-tuned GPT-4o enhances response accuracy  

3. **Fine-Tuned Model for Improved Performance**  
   - Trained on MedQA, BioSQA, PubMedQA, and other datasets  
   - **Domain-specific knowledge adaptation** for consistency and factual accuracy  

4. **Support for Multiple QA Tasks**  
   - **Close-ended QA (multiple-choice, selection-based answers)**  
   - **Long-form QA (detailed answer generation)**

## **🧪 Experimental Results**  

**1️⃣ Document Retrieval Performance**  
- Semantic Search outperforms traditional Lexical Search in **NDCG and MRR scores**  
- **More accurate biomedical literature retrieval**  

**2️⃣ Close-ended QA Performance**  
- Achieves higher accuracy on MedQA, PubMedQA, and BioASQ  

**3️⃣ Long-form QA Performance**  
- MedBioRAG improves **ROUGE and BLEU scores over GPT-4o**  
- Enhances **response coherence and factual accuracy**
